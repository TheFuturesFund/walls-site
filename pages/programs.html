      The Walls uses the universal medium of art to initiate community outreach.
      Through a neutral platform, we are able to positively engage the community,
      include them in the planning, and create a trust. With the initiation of
      murals and other public art works, we are able to revitalize a community,
      create a sense of pride, establish a new momentum in the community.
