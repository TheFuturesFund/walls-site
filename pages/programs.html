    The Walls uses the universal medium of art to initiate community outreach.
    Through a neutral platform, we are able to postively engage the community,
    include them in the planning, and create a trust. With the initiation of
    murals and other public art works, we are able to revitalize a community,
    create a sense of pride, establish a new momentum in the community.
