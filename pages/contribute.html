      <p>
        The Walls recognizes its success is only as good as the collaborative efforts of the public, private, 
        business and arts communities. We actively seek out partners to assist in creating a vibrant cultural economy. 
        This can come in a variety of forms and collaborations such as providing internships for students, becoming a 
        resource partner for arts and workforce development programs, assisting in the identification of real-estate for murals, 
        etc.  We are open to discuss how our partners might bring new and innovative configurations of capability and knowledge 
        to the placemaking table.  We look forward to the opportunity to create with you.
      </p>
