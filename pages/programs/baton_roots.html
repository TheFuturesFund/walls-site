			<p class="introduction-p">By blending access to fresh food, skill-development, socialization, and art into one location, Capital Fresh brings an 
               opportunity for our community to learn best practices in sustainable agriculture on an urban farm. Developed by The 
               Walls Project, this multi-generational program allows the mergence of hands-on gardening with an artistic 
               environment to ground and inspire community health and wellness.

<br/><br/>
Student-managed farm areas will allow elementary, middle, and high school students to learn the skills needed to 
               grow and maintain a working business. From planting and harvesting to monitoring quality control, to distribution, 
               students are required to problem solve, anticipate change, manage a workload, and communicate in teams.
<br/><br/>
In addition to a student focus, Capital Fresh incorporates an intergenerational garden that will play a larger role in 
               impacting all community members. Improving community connections and reducing social isolation of adults and 
               seniors is a focus of the community garden in addition to growing food. Students are encouraged to work with and 
               get to know their elders. By establishing intergenerational relationships, students gain unspoken societal 
               accountability while elders are able to impart their stories and gain relationships all in the name of a healthy meal.
