  <p class='justify'>
    Those looking to contribute their time and skills to better our community can
    do so in a variety of ways. We offer volunteer opportunities for individuals,
    corporations, schools, clubs, and churches. Every year we host our largest
    volunteer effort, the MLK Festival of Service, focusing around initiating
    reactivation in targeted areas. The event is a four-day long festival, circling
    around the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday on the second Monday of each January.
