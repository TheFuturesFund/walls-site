 Upon completion of the 3 levels, students may apply to our Work-study program. In this program, students are given real
  assignments with real clients. Although an instructor is on-hand for help, the students are tasked with divvying up 
  assignments, making sure they are completed, fit the specs and are delivered on time.

  bio: |
    is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
    is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
    using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
