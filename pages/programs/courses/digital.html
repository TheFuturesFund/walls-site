    Upon completion of the 3 levels, students may apply to our Work-study program. In
    this program, students are given real assignments with real clients. Although an
    instructor is on-hand for help, the students are tasked with divvying up assignments,
    making sure they are completed, fit the specs and are delivered on time.

  bio: |
    is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
    is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
    using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
