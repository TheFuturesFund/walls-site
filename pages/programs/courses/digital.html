  But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
  and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
  and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
  master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure
  itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
  pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during
the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
